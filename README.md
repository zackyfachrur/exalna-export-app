Global trade and cross-border e-commerce are surging, yet many firms remain sidelined. The root issues: affordable, trustworthy suppliers are hard to reach, and international transactions are complex. Buyers waste hours sifting through platforms, comparing prices, and checking quality, still unsure. Sellers struggle to enter foreign markets because of language, regulations, and visibility hurdles. The market needs an AI-driven solution that streamlines import-export and delivers strategic insights for smarter global trade decisions.
